# nbtool-manager
A lightweight manager for registering and browsing Jupyter tools

## Notebook Tool Manager API

The Notebook Tool Manager API consists of two components: a singleton manager which registers and lists tools, 
as well as a simple interface a tool can implement to provide its metadata and rendering instructions.

### Tool Manager Singleton
* **register(tool): id**
    * Registers a tool with the manager, passing in an object that implements the Notebook Tool interface (see below). 
    Returns an ID unique to this toolâ€™s registration.
* **unregister(id): boolean**
    * Unregisters a tool with the tool manager. Accepts the ID returned by the register() function and returns True 
    if the tool was successfully unregistered
* **list(): list**
    * Lists all currently registered tools
* **modified(): timestamp**
    * Returns a timestamp of the last time the list of registered tools was modified (register or unregister). This is 
    useful when caching the list of tools.

### Notebook Tool Interface
* **load(): boolean**
    * Function to call when a notebook first loads (for example, import dependencies, add new cell type to the menu, 
    add buttons to the toolbar, etc.).
* **render(cell): boolean**
    * Function to call when you click on a tool in the navigation. Returns true if it successfully 
    rendered.

> The following is metadata the tool defines and which may be used to render a description of the tool

* **origin: string**
    * Identifier for the origin of the tool (local execution, specific GenePattern server, GenomeSpace, etc.)
* **id: string**
    * identifier unique within an origin (example: LSID)
* **name: string**
    * What we display to the user
* **version: string** (optional)
    * To identify particular versions of a tool 
* **description: string** (optional)
    * Brief description of the tool
* **tags: list** (optional)
    * Categories or other navigation aids
* **attributes: dict** (optional)
    * Tool-specific metadata which may be useful to the tool.
